# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview:
  - The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether or not there is bias towards favourable reviews by Amazon Vine members from a digital video game dataset.

## Results:
  - This dataset did not have vine reviews therefore all are nulls
## Summary:
  - One wouldn't know if there is any bias because there was no review
  - No additional analysis would be necessary.
